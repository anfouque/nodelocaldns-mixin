# Prometheus Monitoring Mixin for NodeLocalDNS
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/povilasv/nodelocaldns-mixin/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/povilasv/nodelocaldns-mixin)

A set of Prometheus alerts for Node Local DNS.

Example of generated alerts is located in [example/prometheus_alerts.yaml](https://github.com/povilasv/nodelocaldns-mixin/blob/master/example/prometheus_alerts.yaml)

## How to use

This mixin is designed to be vendored into the repo with your infrastructure config.
To do this, use [jsonnet-bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler):

You then have three options for deploying your dashboards
1. Generate the config files and deploy them yourself


## Generate config files

You can manually generate the alerts, dashboards and rules files, but first you
must install some tools:

```
$ go get github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb
$ brew install jsonnet
```

Then, grab the mixin and its dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/povilasv/nodelocaldns-mixin
$ cd nodelocaldns-mixin
$ jb install
```

Finally, build the mixin:

```
$ make prometheus_alerts.yaml
```

The `prometheus_alerts.yaml` and `prometheus_rules.yaml` file then need to passed to your Prometheus server.
